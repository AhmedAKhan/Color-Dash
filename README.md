Objective
The objective of the game is to survive as long as you can. The player has can go through the coloured sections if they are the same color. You can change your players color with the keys z, x, and c. Each color corresponds to one of the three primary color wheels. You can make the rest of the colors by combining the combinations of the primary colours. 
for example green and red make yellow. 

The color wheel coresponds to the additive color (rgb) wheel because in the game the player and the sections are glowing therefore they are emitting light.

Red 	+ 	Green 	= Yellow

Green 	+ 	Blue	= Turquoise

Blue 	+ 	Red		= Purple
